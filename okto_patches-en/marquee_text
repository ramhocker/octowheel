# The marquee text. May contain all characters from marquee.tbl
# (that is .,-©/?=←℗*)
# and may additionally reference tiles via byte address.
# Spaces (also on line ends) are significant. Line breaks are ignored.
#
# Byte addresses /must/ be specified on separate lines that start with a
# dollar sign. Spaces in these lines are /not/ significant and will be
# ignored. The byte values then need to be separated from the dollar sign
# and from each other by whitespace.
#
# There are 350 characters available. Each byte address counts as one
# character. The text may be shorter than 350 characters.
#
# Make sure that there is at least a space character at the end of the
# text, otherwise the last character will be immediately followed by the
# first character again.
