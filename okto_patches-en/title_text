## There are 19 lines available for text (actually a bit more, but they
## will not be fully visible on an NTSC screen).
## Each line can contain up to 32 characters.
## The first line sits between both images.
## But there is a maximum number of 299 characters (including newlines) that
## can fit into the available byte area.
##
## The allowed characters are: A-Za-z0-9,./&©℗?!"’=-←* and the space character
## The hack script will replace lowercase chars with uppercase chars and
## replace all characters with the corresponding hex values.
## It assumes that the tiles containing the actual charaters are not
## modified. If they are (e.g. if the © is not used and should be replaced
## by a ö and the tile is modified accordingly, the hack script will still
## assume the © as input in this file for that tile. If it should accept
## the actual ö character the tbl-file must be changed accordingly.
## To also change the vim syntax highlighting in this file, the sytax file
## must be adapted as well.
##
## The hack script also adds 0x80 to the last character of each line
## (to indicate the line end) and calculate the correct offset for the
## next line of text.
##
## Do not change the number of lines! All lines (except comments) are
## significant.
